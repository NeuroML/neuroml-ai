    Expected format: ``"scheme:location"``.

    If ``create`` is ``True``, the store is created if it does not exist
    (relevant for ChromaDB which requires a local directory).  For
    Qdrant and PGVector the flag is a no-op --- collections are created
    on first write.

    For ChromaDB, ``location`` must point at the store folder.  Chroma
    always stores its database as ``<folder>/chroma.sqlite3`` and the
    filename is not configurable, so a path pointing at an existing file
    (even the ``chroma.sqlite3`` itself) is rejected.  The collection
    ``name`` selects which collection within the store file is
    addressed: a single ChromaDB store file can hold multiple
    collections, so reusing an existing folder with a new collection
    name creates a new collection in it.

    New Chroma collections are created with the :data:`CHROMA_HNSW_SPACE`
    HNSW distance space (cosine).  The configuration is only applied at
    collection creation; loading an existing collection keeps its own
    distance space.
