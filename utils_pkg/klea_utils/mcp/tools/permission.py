    Reads the ``checkpaths`` key from *tool_meta* (the ``meta`` dict of an

    For each declared argument name that is present in *arguments*, the value
    is checked with :func:`check_path_access`.  Unlike
    :func:`check_path_access`, this never raises: denied paths are collected
    and returned as human-readable messages so the caller (the tool caller
    node) can turn them into a non-halting error result without invoking the
    tool.

    Values that are not strings or path-like (e.g. an int) are skipped with a
    warning, so a mistyped declaration cannot crash the gate.

    :param tool_meta: Tool ``meta`` dict (``Tool.meta`` from ``mcp_tools``),
